## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r widget, echo=FALSE}
#setwd("C:/Repos/GH/MiscellaneousSamples/rproject/rmdwidget/psgwidget")

defects <- read.csv("C:/Repos/GH/MiscellaneousSamples/rproject/rmdwidget/psgwidget/defects.csv")

# Reinstalling the widget and run it. 
#devtools::install()
library(psgwidget)
psgwidget(message="Hello to the world", data=defects)

```
